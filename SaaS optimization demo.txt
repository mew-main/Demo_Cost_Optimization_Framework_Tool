GOAL:
Build a prototype demo app that simulates a 'Cost Optimization Framework for Legacy SaaS Apps'*
this prototype should include an ‚ÄúAI Opportunity Layer‚Äù ‚Äî initial goal is to be able to showcase this via a link to my GitHub portfolio or better if possible linking directly via something like LinkedIn or job boards as I'm looking to catch attention of prospective employers.  
*to clarify showcase this should include both interactive web app and static report capability 


Suggested Tech Stack (Beginner-Friendly)
Area			Tool/Language	 
IDE			Cursor
Backend			Python (Flask or Streamlit) - for now go with Streamlit 
Frontend/UI		Streamlit (recommended)	
Data			CSV/JSON (mock data)	
AI Features		I will decide but follow best practices for creating a config file for API keys, etc.
Docs/Presentation	PowerPoint (I will create this)	 


Outline - 
for info purposes - here is the Concept (PM Work)
‚Ä¢	the concept is to develop a tool to help w/quantifying criteria for retiring vs replatforming vs replacing features based on below metrics 



new recommended analyzer calulation 
value_score = (
    (usage_per_month * user_satisfaction_score)
    / (infra_cost + support_cost + underutilization_penalty)
)

Here‚Äôs what each term could represent (mocked or estimated):

Metric	Description
usage_per_month	How much the app is used (mocked metric)
user_satisfaction_score	Simple 1‚Äì5 scale (e.g., from feedback or NPS)
infra_cost	Hosting/infrastructure cost (mocked $/month)
support_cost	Multiply # of support tickets √ó average resolution cost
underutilization_penalty	Penalty for low active usage compared to licenses purchased


‚úçÔ∏è 1. Create the Mock Dataset using below as an example for single month - annualize this example w/somewhat similar but random numbers per each month of 12 months
usage_per_month = 12000
user_satisfaction_score = 4.2
infra_cost = 3000
support_cases = 15
avg_support_cost = 50
support_cost = support_cases * avg_support_cost  # = 750
underutilization_penalty = 500

value_score = (usage_per_month * user_satisfaction_score) / (infra_cost + support_cost + underutilization_penalty)

Store this as data/legacy_features.csv

üíª 2. Build the Interactive Demo App (in Cursor)  - add "# comments where helpful for a beginner programmer"
a. App UI (Streamlit)
# app.py
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
from modules.analyzer import analyze_features
st.title("Legacy SaaS Cost Optimization Tool")

data = pd.read_csv("data/legacy_features.csv")
st.dataframe(data)

if st.button("Run Analysis"):
    result = analyze_features(data)
    st.dataframe(result)

b. Analyzer Module
# modules/analyzer.py
def analyze_features(df):
    df['value_score'] = (df['usage_per_month'] / df['infra_cost']) - df['support_tickets']
    df['action'] = df['value_score'].apply(lambda x: 'Retire' if x < 0 else 'Keep/Improve')
    return df

üî• 3. Create Heatmap of Cost vs Value 
If you're feeling more technical, use matplotlib or seaborn to plot:
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


4. - use the following as guidelines but highlight and ask about possible different opinions on following "best practice" security and recommendations  -

üö´ Sensitive Info You Should NOT Upload
Info Type	Example	Where to store it	Why not upload?
API Keys	OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-abc...	.env file	Someone could steal your API access (and cost you money!)
Secret tokens	Any login or token	.env	Private credentials = potential security breach
Personal data	Real user data	Don‚Äôt include it	Legal/privacy risks

also highlight sensitive files that should be included in "gitigore" like 'api keys', etc
